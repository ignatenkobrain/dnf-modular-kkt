# How does DNF do dependency resolution wron (for modularity)

## What does DNF do today?

1. Resolves dependencies between modules (and consider them as enabled)
2. Filter out RPMs which are in non-enabled modules (exclude, disable)
3. Install RPMs from profile

## So what's wrong with it?

It resolves dependencies between modules and rpms at different points of time.

## Example

We have `test-app` rpm which depends on `kkt >= 50`. And we have 2 `kkt`
build versions: `30` and `80`.

And they are packed into a modules as following:

* `kkt:konsky:2019:deadbeef:x86_64`
  * Contains `kkt-80-1.x86_64`
* `kkt:barani:2019:bbadbeef:x86_64`
  * Contains `kkt-30-1.x86_64`
* `test-app:master:2019:deadbeef:x86_64`:
  * Contains `test-app-1-1.x86_64`
  * Requires `kkt: []`

That means, if you would be about to install `test-app`, you would get
`test-app-1-1` and `kkt-80-1`â€¦ But not with DNF. What you will get is:

```
Error:
 Problem: package test-app-1-1.x86_64 requires kkt >= 50, but none of the providers can be installed
  - conflicting requests
  - package kkt-80-1.x86_64 is excluded
```

Try it yourself!

```
$ ./build.sh
$ sudo rm -rf /var/cache/dnf/test*
$ sudo dnf --repofrompath=test,$PWD/repo module install test-app
```
